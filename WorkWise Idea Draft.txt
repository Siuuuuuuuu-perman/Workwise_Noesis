WorkWise AI — Technical Concept and Project Brief

1. Overview
WorkWise AI is a scalable artificial intelligence system designed to assist individuals
affected by automation and shifting labor markets. The platform analyzes a person’s
existing skills, identifies transferable competencies, predicts automation risk for their
profession, and recommends actionable reskilling pathways. The objective is to reduce
structural unemployment by connecting displaced workers to emerging job
opportunities through intelligent AI-driven guidance.

2. Problem Statement
Automation is transforming industries at an unprecedented pace. Millions of jobs are
being augmented or replaced by intelligent systems, leaving many workers uncertain
about future employment. Traditional job portals list vacancies but fail to provide
individualized transition guidance or skill mapping. There is a critical need for adaptive
tools that can interpret human capability, understand evolving labor trends, and guide
reskilling with precision and empathy.

3. Proposed Solution
WorkWise AI serves as a digital career advisor powered by advanced NVIDIA AI
infrastructure. It operates as an orchestrated set of specialized agents working
collaboratively to extract user skills, assess job-market compatibility, identify learning
pathways, and forecast automation vulnerability. The system delivers a dynamic and
personalized employment roadmap within a single platform.

4. System Architecture
The architecture combines NVIDIA's AI and inference technologies with modular
service orchestration for scalability and speed.

5. Technical Stack
• Nemotron: NVIDIA large language model for resume comprehension, skill reasoning,
and contextual job analysis.
• NIM (NVIDIA Inference Microservices): Enables rapid, containerized deployment of
model endpoints for real-time inference.
• MCP (Multi-Agent Collaboration Platform): Coordinates specialized AI agents and
manages inter-agent communication.
• Frontend: Implemented using Streamlit or React with Tailwind CSS for quick UI
prototyping.
• Backend: Python (FastAPI) serving endpoints for agents and data aggregation.
• External Data Sources: O*NET occupational database, LinkedIn/Indeed job APIs,
Coursera and edX course APIs.
• Development Environment: NVIDIA AI Workbench for rapid container setup and
integration testing.

6. Workflow
1. User uploads a resume or describes their current role.
2. Nemotron model extracts relevant skills and professional history.
3. MCP orchestrates AI agents for skill mapping, job retrieval, course recommendation,
and automation-risk evaluation.
4. NIM manages low-latency inference services for all model endpoints.
5. The frontend visualizes insights through a personalized dashboard and interactive
chat interface.
6. The user receives a clear reskilling roadmap and direct links to actionable
opportunities.
